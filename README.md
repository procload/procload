### ⚡️ Ryan Merrill

I like my friends old, music loud, and work tough.

That mindset comes from a midwestern work ethic forged near the abandoned steel yards of the Great Lakes. I grew up on a steady diet of underdog sports teams, brutal winters and minimalist writers—distilling in me a utilitarian approach to design and a desire to celebrate victories of any size.

- 🧙🏼‍♂️ I'm a Senior UX Engineering manager at Microsoft creating design systems and component libraries with web components.

- 🧰 I use `html`, `css`, `python`, and `typescript` to hack on the web and experiment with generative AI.
